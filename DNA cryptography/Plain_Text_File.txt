Nowadays,the amount of data produced and stored in computing
devices is increasing at an alarming rate. Tremendous amounts
of critical and sensitive data are transmitted between all
these devices. Thus, it is very imperative to guarantee the
security of all these indispensable data. Cryptography is a
commonly used technique to ensure data security every simple. The fundamental
objective of cryptography is to transmit data from the sender
to the receiver in the most secure way, so that an attacker is
